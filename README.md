## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to understand the bikeshare data. We used different visulization tools such as line graphs, heatmaps, and lat/long maps. 

## Results

In this map we find that most bikes are used in Manhatten and less are used in surrounding bourghs. We also find that the bigger red dots are where bikes routes start most frequently.
